[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/sanster23/learn-go-with-tests)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/sanster23/learn-go-with-tests)

Getting started with Golang with a bit of TDD and good practices.

## Discipline

- Write a test
- Make the compiler pass
- Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
- Write enough code to make the test pass
- Refactor

## Road so far...

1. Install Go - Setup the golang environment
2. Hello World - Declare variables, constants, if/else statements, switch cases, go syntax and the very first program with test case.
3. Integers - Further Explore function declaration syntax and learn new ways to improve the documentation of your code.
